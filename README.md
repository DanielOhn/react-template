# React Template

Made this as a template for React with the files organized and certain packages added, such as prettier.

Removed the clutter that usually comes with `npx create-react-app`.

## Usage

Clone repo and run the following:

> npm install

> npm start

That should get it running.

Make sure to update `.prettierrc` with your preferred settings.
